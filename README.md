# Azure-Data-Engineering

Azure Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering solution using the Azure ecosystem. The use case involves building a scalable and secure data platform, starting from data ingestion to reporting, providing a hands-on approach to modern data engineering practices.
Project Overview

The project follows the below workflow:

    Data Ingestion:
    Ingested tables from an on-premises SQL Server database to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using Azure Data Factory.

    Data Storage:
    Leveraged Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for secure and scalable data storage.

    Data Transformation:
    Processed and enriched raw data in Azure Databricks, converting it into a refined format suitable for analytics.

    Data Loading and Querying:
    Loaded transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics to enable powerful querying capabilities.

    Interactive Reporting:
    Integrated Microsoft Power BI with Azure Synapse Analytics to create interactive dashboards providing real-time insights.

    Security and Governance:
    Ensured data platform security using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) and Azure Key Vault for managing sensitive information like secrets and keys.

Tools and Technologies Used

    Azure Data Factory: For orchestrating data ingestion workflows.
    Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: For scalable and secure data storage.
    Azure Databricks: For data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment.
    Azure Synapse Analytics: For data warehousing and querying.
    Microsoft Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards.
    Microsoft Entra ID (AAD): For access control and governance.
    Azure Key Vault: For securely storing secrets, keys, and certificates.
